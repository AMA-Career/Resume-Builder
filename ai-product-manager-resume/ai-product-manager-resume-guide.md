#### ✅ Step 1: Tailor to the Job Description
- **Keyword Mapping:** Extract 8–12 distinct AI and PM keywords from the job listing (e.g., NLP, computer vision, model governance, A/B testing platform). Build a checklist and naturally include each keyword in your Skills, Summary, and Experience sections.
- **Contextual Bullets:** Don’t just list skills—show them in action.
- **Mirror Phrasing & Tone:** Match the job’s language. If they say “collaborate with data scientists”, don’t say “partnered with analytics teams”—this boosts ATS match rate.
- **Prioritize Content:** Reorder bullets so the top 1–2 in each role reflect the most critical job responsibilities.

#### ✅ Step 2: Craft a Compelling Summary
- **Quantify Up Front:** Lead with your biggest AI win.
- **Show Strategic Impact:** Connect actions to outcomes.
- **Embed Keywords:** Include 2–3 high-value terms like machine learning, roadmapping, or stakeholder alignment.
- **Keep It Tight:** Aim for 2–3 sentences (no more than 50 words) to immediately grab attention.

#### ✅ Step 3: Highlight Your Technical & Strategic Skills
- **Categorize & Cluster:** Organize skills into clear sections:
    - AI: TensorFlow, NLP, PyTorch
    - Product: Agile, Roadmapping, JIRA
    - Leadership: Executive Communication, Vendor Negotiation
- **Emphasize Depth:** Add context to top skills, e.g.: Machine Learning (Python, scikit-learn, deep learning pipelines)
- **Align with Tools:** Use the exact tools mentioned in the job post (AWS SageMaker, not just “cloud tools”).
- **Include Soft Skills:** Under leadership, show capabilities like: Cross-functional Facilitation, Stakeholder Alignment, Team Scaling

#### ✅ Step 4: Quantify Your Work Experience
- **Action → Outcome → Metric:**
Example:
Orchestrated launch of a real-time fraud detection system → reduced false positives → by 45%, saving $3M annually.
- **Highlight Lifecycle Ownership:** Structure roles to showcase involvement in: Ideation → Design → Build → Deploy → Monitor.
- **Use Estimates Thoughtfully:**
Example:
Deployed A/B tests on recommendation engine → improved CTR by 15–20%.
- **Show Cross-Team Impact:** Name collaborators like data scientists, engineers, UX researchers to reflect real AI context.

### ✅ Step 5: Showcase Education and Certifications
- **Prioritize AI Credentials:** List AI-specific degrees/certs first (e.g., “MS in AI”). Remove graduation years over 10 years old.
- **Include Micro-Credentials:** Examples: Coursera Deep Learning Specialization, Udacity AI Product Manager Nanodegree
- **Highlight Ongoing Learning:** Examples: Stanford AI Accelerator Workshop, OpenAI Product Design Hackathon
- **Link Your Portfolio:** Add a GitHub/portfolio link with AI PM case studies or demos to show hands-on capability.
